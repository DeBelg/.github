<!-- ## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to RLN! -->
## ðŸš¯ Rate-Limiting Nullifier
**RLN** is a [zero-knowledge](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) gadget that enables spam prevention in anonymous environments ðŸ§™

*Circuits, contracts, and libraries are not audited yet, please use caution when considering these for production*

* [Documentation](https://rate-limiting-nullifier.github.io/rln-docs/) - Learn how RLN works

* [RLN Circuits v2](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/rln-circuits-v2) - Circom circuits for RLN (version 2)

* [RLNjs](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/rlnjs) - Javascript (Typescript) library for RLN

* [Persistent Merkle Tree (PMTree)](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/pmtree) - Rust Persistent Merkle Tree library in collaboration with Vac team to support the RLN ecosystem.

*This Github organization is maintained by the **PSE** ([Privacy & Scaling Explorations](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/)), a multidisciplinary team supported by the **Ethereum Foundation**. **PSE** explores new use cases for zero-knowledge proofs and other cryptographic primitives.*
